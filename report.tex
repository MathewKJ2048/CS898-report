\begin{abstract}

This report describes a method by which Wang cubes tiling 3D space can be used to simulate digital circuits, and presents a web-app to run such simulations. It also describes an efficient algorithm used to compute adjacent planes along the z-axis, along with the software architecture and technology used to create the web-app. Common elements of digital circuits (such as clocks, wires, logic gates, \emph{et cetera}), along with the challenges of instantiating them using Wang cubes, are discussed here.

\end{abstract}

% Bridges papers are usually no more than 8 pages in length.  So
% there's really no need to have numbered sections, unless the
% author really needs to refer to sections by number within the paper's text.  
% So to suppress sequential section numbers, append an asterisk to 
% the \section command, as in:


\section*{Architecture}

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]

	\caption{A UML class diagram describing the ontology underlying the system}
	\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

A "tile type" refers to an entity that describes the adjacency rules which determine the legality of a tiling. A tile is a combination of a tile type with a position vector (a vector being a 2-tuple of real numbers). All tiles have positions which are aligned with the grid - each number in the 2-tuple is an integer.

A tiling is a collection of tiles in the x-y plane. The function mapping the tiles in a plane tiling to the set of tile types is surjective, but not necessarily injective. The function mapping the tiles in a tiling to the set of all possible positions is surjective, and not injective (since there are an infinite possible number of positions, and the number of tiles is finite).


Instead of using colors, the adjacency rules for tiles are enforced using strings. A significant advantage of using unicode strings instead of RGB 3-tuples is that a string is self-documenting. Another advantage is that strings are easy to tell apart from each other, unlike close shades of colors. Furthermore, the system is designed such that one can use it even if completely color-blind, albeit not as efficiently as if one can perceive colors perfectly.

A Wang file consists of a global set of tile types, a main tiling (on which most of the work is done), a cached tiling (used to implement resets while editing), a collection of sub tilings (which can be copied from and pasted into the main plane tiling) and a global color map that maps strings to colors. 

The entire state of the data is stored in the Wang file, and the Wang file can be exported and imported via JSON serialization. This process presents the following challenges:


\begin{itemize}
	\item JSON objects do not preserve references, so if multiple tiles have references to the same tile type object, deserialization creates two distinct but identical tile type objects. This is resolved using a readonly static UID associated with the tile type class, which is used to collapse references to identical tile types into a single object. 
	\item JSON objects carry only data and do not record non-static functions. This is resolved by replacing all non-static functions with static functions bound to the class, that takes an additional argument in place of "this" that the non-static function operates on.
	
\end{itemize}

\section*{Technology}

The software was designed to be a web-app, since this would allow it to be used by anyone with a browser. This also saves a lot of developer effort that would otherwise be spent in packaging the software for various operating systems and platforms.

The following technology was used in the web-app:

\begin{itemize}
	\item HTML5, which is the industry standard for web development, used for the high-level structure of the web-app
	\item NPM (Node package manager), used to install and maintain dependencies
	\item SASS (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets), which is a superset of CSS with additional syntactic sugar, used for styling the elements of the web-app
	\item TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript with a typing system, used for the describing the algorithms, data structures and UI interactions of the web-app
	\item 3js, a package used to render objects in 3D using a WebGL context, without having to write any WebGL code directly
	\item Vite, used to manage the compilation to CSS/JavaScript, minification, tree-shaking and bundling the web-app into a small, portable form
	\item Vitepress, a static site generator used to generate the user manual from markdown source files
	\item GitHub actions, used as a CI/CD solution to build and publish the web-app incrementally
	\item GitHub pages, used to host the web-app online
\end{itemize}

In addition, the icons for the web-app were sourced from Google Material icons, downloaded as SVG images.


\section*{LLM disclosure}

No LLMs were used in the generation of this report or the user manual for the web-app. However, when writing the code for the web-app, the involvement of LLMs is difficult to quantify and disentangle from the code written by a human, for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Development often involves copying and pasting code from online forums such as StackOverflow. The source of the content on such forums cannot be guaranteed to be written by a human, unless accompanied with a timestamp preceding the release of popular LLMs like ChatGPT.
	\item Since search engines integrate AI assistance with their service, searching for a topic results in the user being exposed to an AI-generated answer that appears before every search result. This could subtly influence the thought-process of the user, guiding them toward certain implementations and solutions.
	\item Popular code-editors like Copilot now integrate agentic coding assistants powered by LLMs, which autocomplete code snippets and generate functions from comments. Though no such editor has been used in the development of this web-app, it is often the case that the coder does not have direct control over what editor they are allowed to use.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Some Guide on Content}

% And don't try to mix and match numbered and unnumbered sections; it's one or the other.

Let's start with some advice on the subject matter and content of a
Bridges paper, since this should be an author's first concern. The
Bridges Proceedings are considered a refereed journal, and as such we
are trying to maintain quality standards that will make its papers count
in academic personnel reviews and promotion cases. Thus, most
importantly, every paper should present some novel achievements,
experiments, artwork, and/or insights by the authors. General reviews or
tutorials, cobbled together from various blogs or Wikipedia pages are
not appropriate. Also, keep in mind that the number of pages in the
Proceedings as well as your presentation time at the conference are
limited; so choose a scope for your presentation that fits into these
constraints.

\textbf{Regular papers} should be either 8 or 6 pages, including references. Every paper should nicely
fill an even number of pages without a lot of wasted white space, so
that we can make optimal use of the Proceedings pages and start every
paper on a right-hand page.

\textbf{Short papers}, which have a later submission deadline, should be
4 or 2 pages long, including references. Here it is particularly important to focus 
on just one or two novel ideas and results. Short papers are not a good medium
to give tutorial introductions or cursory reviews over a domain that could be the 
subject of one or more books. Also, this is not the place to give preliminary ideas 
on new teaching experiments, or to present intuitive hunches how some classical 
artwork might be analyzed in a novel way. A Bridges paper should only be submitted 
after the experiments or novel analysis have been performed and when concrete results are available.

The program committee has found that certain types of papers almost always 
need to be rejected: papers on numerology or work that extracts numbers or 
ratios from artwork or architecture. A somewhat ``fuzzy'' search for the Golden 
Ratio (or any other ratio) will almost always produce some hits (a simple matter of 
statistics). However, such coincidences do not tell us anything about the method 
or intent of the creator of those artifacts, unless there is some other
compelling evidence, such as auxiliary lines or notes that explicitly
state what the artist or architect was doing.

Please write your paper in such a way that attendees with a general
education can follow your discourse without the need to look up several
references to find out what the main gist is of your paper. Skip lengthy
sections on \emph{background} and \emph{previous work} and instead give
clear and detailed explanations on your novel contributions, ideally
well-supported with diagrams and/or images.

\section*{Use of this Template}

\noindent If you are writing your paper using \LaTeX, please use a
copy of the source \texttt{.tex} file for this document as your starting point. Some 
useful \LaTeX\ resources are \cite{Chang, Gratzer}. This template (with its accompanying 
style file) has been set with the proper paper size and all the necessary \emph{styles} for
proper formatting. Just replace the text in this file with your own text. Also substitute 
your own images for the figures in this template, either as an individual figure like 
Figure \ref{fig:1}, or, alternatively, as in the composite Figure \ref{fig:2}. Each figure is then 
followed by a \verb|\caption|.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.4in]{figures/figure1.jpg}
	\caption{An individual figure \cite{Sequin2016}. Make it large enough so that necessary 
	details can be seen.\\ Fine-tune its size, so that you obtain convenient page breaks.}
	\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Paper Size, Margins, and Styles}

The Proceedings will be printed using US Letter size paper (8.5 by 11
inches) as in this document. If you are working outside the USA, please
check that you have not used A4 paper, which may be the default in your
country. Do not insert page numbers, headers or footers; these will be
inserted later at the publishing stage.

This template has the proper styles set in the \texttt{bridges.sty} file. 
The result should conform to the following specifications: On the first page, 
the distance from the top edge of the paper to the first line of the title should 
be 3~cm ($1+3/16$ inches). On the second and subsequent pages, the distance 
from the top edge of the paper to the top of the first line of type should be
2.5~cm (1~inch). The widths of the margins on left and right edges and
at the bottom of the page should all be 2.5~cm (1~inch) as well.

The font is \emph{Times New Roman}. The text of the main body,
as well as the figure captions use size 11~pt. Section headings,
authors, and affiliations are size 12~pt. Paper title is 16~pt. Abstract
is 9~pt. Use this template to see what items are printed in \textbf{bold
face} or in \emph{italics}. Use italics for emphasis, rather than blood face (which reads like yelling.)
Mathematical expressions are typeset 
in the same font as the body text, as in $\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$. 

There should be no indentation for the first paragraph after a section heading. Subsequent paragraphs in that section will be indented. The style file will attend to this behavior, and will also justify text to both the left and right margins. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Figures and Tables}

You must obtain permission and provide attribution to use any copyrighted material. 
Images should be high quality. The proceedings will be produced in full color both online and in print.
But be careful that your images do not make your final PDF larger than 10~Mb;
in that case you may need to downsample your image files to reduce their size.

To insert a figure, use the \emph{figure} environment. For this template, all
image files are placed in the \texttt{images} folder, located in the directory containing the source 
\texttt{.tex} file. Figure captions will be numbered and labeled automatically. Hence the boldface text 
``\textbf{Figure 1:}'' does not need to be typed as part of the figure caption, nor does the 
italic font style need to be specified; these are handled automatically by the Bridges style file.

Figure \ref{fig:2} shows how to format and caption a figure with multiple panels. 
Here we use the \emph{subcaption} package, which enables the \verb|\subcaption| 
command. Leave the subfigure captions blank to automatically label the panels 
(a), (b), etc. We ensure that the full figure does not exceed the width of a full line 
of text by setting the width of each individual panel to be an appropriate proportion of the 
\verb|\textwidth|.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.2\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure2a.png}
        	\subcaption{} % Add subcaption text if desired, or use \subcaption* to suppress (a), (b), etc. labels

(b) 2-hole torus of genus 2,  (c) handle-body of genus 3,  (d) handle-body of genus 7.}
\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}
% NOTE: As an alternative, you could use \caption instead of \subcaption for the individual panels, 
% and remove the composite \caption at the bottom. This will produce separate side-by-side figures,
% each with its own Figure number.


Tables are mostly treated just like figures, except that the caption is 
is placed \emph{above} the table body. This is accomplished by placing the 
\verb|\caption| before the table data. In this example we reduce the font size 
in the \emph{tabular} environment so the table fits within the margins. 
All figures and tables must be referenced and explained in the main text, and they must
not bleed into the margins.

\section*{Sections and Subsections}

Important words should be capitalized in your paper's title and section
headings, while conjunctions (e.g., ``and'' / ``or'') and prepositions
(e.g., ``of'' / ``with'') begin with a lower case letter. Avoid most punctuation 
(one colon or comma is acceptable). Do not end a lone title or section heading with a period. 
For section headings use \verb|\section*|. Do not use numbered sections
unless you refer to a section by number rather than title in the text. 
If you must have your sections numbered use the \verb|\section| 
command. For any Bridges paper, it would probably be excessive to use 
more than two levels of hierarchy in your document. In all papers the \textbf{Abstract}, 
\textbf{Acknowledgments}, and \textbf{References} headings are unnumbered 
sections.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Subsections}

If needed, you may introduce subsections using the command
\verb|\subsection*|. Subsections are never numbered. Subsection titles 
are 11~pt, left justified, bold, and italicized.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Vertical Spacing and Page Breaks}

The various styles for headings and paragraphs come with their own
built-in vertical spacing. By default they should result in a good-looking layout. 
But occasionally it is necessary to change vertical spacing a little in order to 
avoid inconvenient page breaks. Try to avoid the last line of a paragraph appearing 
at the beginning of the next page and don't leave a section title on a separate page 
from what follows. Feel free to introduce \verb|\vspace*|
or \verb|\pagebreak| to improve layout.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Wrap-up}

% Define BibTeX command for typesetting its logo as it appears the following paragraph -- Feel free 
% to comment this out or delete entirely in your paper.
\def\BibTeX{{\rm B\kern-.05em{\sc i\kern-.025em b}\kern-.08em
    T\kern-.1667em\lower.7ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}}

The paper should end with a brief section that provides some \textbf{Summary and Conclusions}. 
This may be followed by \textbf{Acknowledgments} (optional) and \textbf{References}. Only list 
references that you cite in your paper. List all references alphabetically by last name of first 
author and number them sequentially. When citing references in the text, use \verb|\cite|, as in: 
``see Coxeter \cite{Coxeter}'' or just insert ``\cite{Coxeter}'' after the corresponding quote. 
See the references for correct article \cite{EJCx,Coxeter}, book \cite{Gratzer}, and Bridges 
Conference Proceedings \cite{Sequin2016} citations. Since Bridges papers typically have only 
a few references, we do not require or even recommend that you use \BibTeX, but of course 
you are free to do so. Examples and templates for other types of references can be found in the Guidelines for References section of the Paper Formatting webpage. Don't insert links to references in the body of the paper. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Writing Style and Final Format}

There is no need to use only the passive voice, often encountered in
some formal academic journals. It is perfectly acceptable to use the
first person ``I'' when talking about your own artistic endeavors, and
the inclusive, academic ``we'' works well for more formal statements.

To submit your paper via EasyChair \cite{easychair}, 
you will have to convert it into a PDF (Portable Document Format) file and that file must not exceed 10 MB.
Papers will appear in the online Bridges Archives and in print in full color.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Summary and Conclusions}

Please adhere to the style incorporated in this template, \emph{except} your paper
must end after 2, 4, 6, or 8 pages, \emph{including} references. Substantive
deviations from this style are grounds for rejecting your paper without
any detailed review.
